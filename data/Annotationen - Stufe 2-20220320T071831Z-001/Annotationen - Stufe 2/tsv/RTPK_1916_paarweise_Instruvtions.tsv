"Choose ""1"" for Sentence 1, ""2"" for Sentence 2 and ""0"" for for none of them being metaphoric / equal metaphoricity"	
	
If one sentence is a Grenzfall and the other is clearly non-metaphoric, then choose the Grenzfall	
	
If one is a Grenzfall and the other is clearly metaphoric, choose the metaphoric one	
	
If both are metaphoric, choose the one which you find more metaphoric	
	
"If you find them to be both exactly equally metaphoric, choose ""0"". This includes the case where both are equally non-metaphoric and equal Grenzf√§lle."
